## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- In the image above, we see that the variables/coefficients titled 'vehicle_length' and 'ground clearence' register a significance to the point that we may be almost certain these elements provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values. 'vehicle_weight' 'spoiler_angle' and 'AWD' do not have values small enough to treat the variance as non random. 
- The slope of the linear model cannot be considered as zero. The p-val shown in the last line of the image (5.35e-11) is incredibly small, establishing with extreme certainty that the slope of our linear model cannot be considered 0.
- The model predicts the MPG of the MechaCar prototypes reasonable well. The R-Squared val of our data (0.7149) indicates about ~71.5% accuracy of our linear model.
